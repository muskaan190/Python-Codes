## Future of Python

The future of Python is thus set in stone as the go-to language for developers engaging in deep machine learning projects, companies looking to scale up by using big data analytics or efforts aimed at achieving social applications of automation!
## Merits of Python



->Presence of third-party modules.

->Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.)

->Open source and large active community base.

->Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write.

->User-friendly data structures.

->High-level language.
## Why is it called Python?

While many people assume the name Python Programming comes from something related to the Python snake, it actually comes from the TV comedy series ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus.’ This series broadcast on the BBC channel in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and was a favorite of Guido Van Rossum’s. Because it was short, cryptic, and included the name of his favorite TV comedy show, he chose the name ‘Python.’
## Wide Range of Aspects

ython is a general-purpose programming language. In fact, it can be used in a wide range of coding scenarios like web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, internet of things and many more.
